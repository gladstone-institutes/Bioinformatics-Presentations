# Introduction to Tidyverse

## Tidyverse

-   The tidyverse packages work well together because they share
common data representations and design principles
    -   Rows = observations, columns = variables
-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), for data visualization.
-   [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), for data manipulation.
-   [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), for data tidying.
-   [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), for data import.
-   [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/), for iteration.
-   and more..

## dplyr
-    Offers a common “grammar” of functions for data manipulation   
      -    [mutate()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) adds new variables that are functions of existing
    columns
      -    [select()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) picks columns based on their names
      -    [filter()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) picks rows based on their values
      -    [summarise()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) reduces multiple values down to a single summary
      -    [arrange()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html) changes the ordering of the rows
      -    [group_by()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) allows any operation to be done “by group”



## Example Dataframe
-   mpg is a dataframe built into the ggplot2 package
```{r}
head(mpg)
```


## Select Columns

```{r}
select(.data = mpg,
       year, cty, hwy, manufacturer)
```


## Filter Rows


```{r}
filter(.data = mpg,
       year == 2008)
```


## Arrange Rows

-   desc() is used to arrange rows in descending order, the default is ascending
```{r}
arrange(.data = mpg,
        desc(cty))
```



## Summarising data
-    The dplyr **summarise()** function computes a table of
summaries for a data frame
-    **group_by()** groups the input data frame by the specified
variable(s)
-    Combining these two allows us to easily create summaries for
different categorical groupings

## Group and Summarise

- Get the mean and median city mileage within manufacturer

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summarise(group_by(.data = mpg,
                   manufacturer),
          mean_cty = mean(cty),
          median_cty = median(cty))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summarise(.data = group_by(.data = mpg,
                   manufacturer),
          mean_cty = mean(cty),
          median_cty = median(cty)) |>
  head(10)
```



## The pipe operator |>
-   Allows "chaining" of function calls to make code more readable
```{r}
mpg |>
  group_by(manufacturer) |>
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty),
            median_cty = median(cty)) |>
  head(5)
```



# Plotting

## ggplot2
-    The most popular tidyverse package
-    Create publication quality, highly customizable plots
      -   See the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) for examples
-    ggplots use “layers” to build, modify and overlap visualizations
      - Layers are added using the + symbol and can be added to an existing ggplot
-    Many popular packages output ggplots which can then be easily modified by adding layers


## Creating ggplots

## Plot Example

```{r, fig.dim=c(6,4)}
ggplot(data = mpg,                         # Input dataframe
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +  # Aesthetic mapping
  geom_point()                             # Point graph
```

## Adding and Modifying Layers 

```{r, fig.dim=c(10,4)}
ggplot(data = mpg,                         
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +  
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm")
```


# 10 min break

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}

countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     seconds = 0,
                     color_border = "black",
                     color_running_background = "#47d193",
                     color_finished_background = "#a3184e",
                     padding = "50px",
                     margin = "5%",
                     font_size = "5em",
       style = "position: relative; width: min-content;")
```

# Hands-on Data Analysis

## Dataset Description
-   PanTHERIA
    -   A global species-level data set of key traits of all known extant and recently extinct mammals compiled from literature
    -   Used in macroecological and macroevolutionary research projects
    -   Data is organized by taxonomic rank

## Taxonomic Rank

![Taxonomy](assets/Taxonomic_Rank_Graph.svg)

## Data Preview

```{r, echo = FALSE}
read_xlsx("Intro_to_R_workshop_materials/PanTHERIA.xlsx") |>
  head() |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling("striped") |>
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Hands-on Analysis

-   We will read in the data and explore if the trophic level has a significant impact on the adult body mass of mammals  

Steps:    
1.    Combine and clean the data   
2.    Visualize adult body mass by trophic level  
3.    Check for overrepresented groups  
4.    Fit a simple linear model

# ChatGPT Tips for R

## General Tips

-   Follow any relevant institutional guidelines on using LLMs
-   Always confirm ChatGPT's outputs are correct
-   Provide as much detail as possible about the problem in the 1st prompt
-   Use separate chats for separate tasks/projects
-   Try the 'Custom Instructions' function

## Code Tips

-   Commented R code yields better responses
-   Provide the code and error message in the same prompt
-   ChatGPT can work well to convert syntax and improve your code:
    -   "Turn this loop into a function : [your code]"
    -   "Is there a better way to do this : [your code]"
-   Check out the file: `example_code/1_convert_syntax_example.R` for an example use case
